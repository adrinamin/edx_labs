# edx_labs
This repo contains many edx lab exercises from different courses. It consists of several folders and contains exercises in different programming languages. Currently only C++ but in the future there will be exercise solutions in other programming languages.

You can use the code as help of course (not copy-pasting it blindy &#128521;)
